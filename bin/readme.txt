Application Monitor v1.0

Application Monitor is a program that constantly checks the processes previously chosen by the user, and when it detects that one of those processes has stopped working it will start it again.

With Application Monitor you will always be sure that your important processes are running.

AppMonitor has been developed keeping in mind all those admin and power users who use programs that must always been running (such as webserver, database, mailserver, p2p) and that don't have a built-in restart function.
